# /INTERNPROJ2025

## üìÅ Overview
This folder contains all work completed by the interns at Rincon Research in the Centenial office during the summer of 2025

Project Statement: 
In Rincon Research Coorporation's Internship program in the summer of 2025 four bright interns from a variety of diciplines came together to simulate and realize a bent pipe communication system. Bent pipe communication systems are often used in scenarios where line of sight between a transmitter and a receiver is obscured, or in the scenario where certain frequency bands are denied by an interferer. The task involved extensive research and experimentation with unfamiliar digital signal processing concepts including QPSK modulation, pulse shaping, finite impulse response filters, sampling theory, the cross ambiguity function (CAF), and detection. The experience was rewarding and the final product is nothing shy of cool.
